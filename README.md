# Research Google Chrome APIs

This repo is meant to be non-production code and intended for use
with Google Chrome APIs to discover the applicable, practical, and
relevant usage of Chrome Extensions in future projects that can
effectively solve real world problems.

# Motivation

I am interested in maximizing the usage of the Chrome Browser,
and its extensible framework.  Too often I have seen, or been
forced to use so many tools that it is hard to keep up with the
tech stack an organization provides you.

I believe a well organized set of chrome extensions aligned to use-cases
and purpose can minimize `tool-fatigue` and possible save a few bucks.

I am more inclined to believe one of the most utilized tools in
the workplace is a web-browser, and likely, the Chrome Browser is
one of the most used tools daily by security professionals around the globe.

# Repo Structure
The repo will change as I go along to ensure I am staying organized.
For now as of 12/2018, the repo is organized as:

| Repo Folders | Purpose   |
|--------------|-----------|
| chrome-spec  | My notes/thoughts after reading Chrome Specification
| codelab-extensions | Results from codelabs provide by Google
| practical-extensions | My own adaptation from learning through codelabs
